    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, i.e. the analysis of the feeling expressed in a sentence, is a leading application area in natural language processing (NLP). Indeed, it has attracted the interest of brands, which are interested in analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, so that they can tailor products and services to meet their customers’ needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, basic sentiment analysis attempts to detect the overall polarity of a sentence irrespective of the entities mentioned and their aspects. Therefore, a new task has been introduced: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a text analysis technique that categorizes data by aspect and identifies the sentiment attributed to each one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide a possible solution to two steps of ABSA:\n",
    "1. Aspect term extraction (ATE);\n",
    "2. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a given sentence $s$, which for instance could come from a review of a product or a social media post.\n",
    "A company could be interested in getting to know the major sentiment of the sentence, i.e. whether it is positive, negative or neutral, w.r.t. each of the most important aspects of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence \"The food was delicious, but the prices were a bit high\" has two different polarities to point out, each of which is attributed to a different aspect. Indeed, the sentiment concerning the **food** is positive, while the sentiment concerning the **prices** is negative, and both these informations could be separately interesting to a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to extract such information, we need to first identify the aspects of the sentence, and then extract the sentiment associated to each of them. These are the two separated tasks we are going to approach in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aspect-based term extraction (ABTE): given sentence, identify all apect terms present in the sentence;\n",
    "2. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA): given sentence and an aspect term, identify the sentiment associated to that aspect term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the first task can be seen as a preprocessing step in order to perform the second task, thus, if we deal with data in which the aspects are not manually annotated we should perform ATE and then ABSA. On the other hand, if the aspects are already manually annotated, we can directly perform ABSA in order to extract the sentiment associated to each aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train and test our models we use a dataset containing restaurant reviews, taken from a preprocessed version, available at [1], of the SemEval-2014 ABSA Task [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are organized in a csv file, with the following columns:\n",
    "- **Tokens**: tokenized sentence;\n",
    "- **Tags**: list of tags associated to each token: '0' for non-aspect terms, '1' for beginning of terms and '2' for marks of terms;\n",
    "- **Polarities**: list of polarities associated to each token: '0' for negative, '1' for neutral and '2' for positive and '-1' for non-aspect terms;\n",
    "\n",
    "# Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problems described above, we provide different strategies, all based on the fine-tuning of a pretrained BERT model [3], with the implementation provided by Hugging Face [4].\n",
    "BERT is a bidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence prediction, which can be adapted to a wide range of tasks, including sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tasks are approached with two different BERT based approaches: a straighforward fine-tuning and an adapter, implementation provided by AdapterHub[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-tuning** consist of taking pretrained model ('bert-base-uncased' in our case) and train in specifically for ATE and ABSE. Thus, the idea is to update the entire copy of the original pretrained model, which turns out to be not efficient. See Figure 1 below [3] for a summary of the model architecture for fine-tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"imgs/fine_tuning.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adapter modules** have been introduced [6] as a more efficient approach than fine-tuning. In this scenario, the parameters of the original model are fixed, and one has to train only a few trainable parameters per task: these new task-specific parameters are called adaptors. See Figure 1 below [6] for a summary of the adapter architecture: \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"imgs/adapter_architecture.png\" width=\"850\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for ATE we feed the transformer with the list of indices of words in the vocabulary. On the other hand, in ABSE we first concatenate the aspect with the list of sentence tokens as follows:\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "    ['w1', 'w2', 'w3', ... , 'wN', '[CLS]', 'aspect']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we feed the transformer with the list of indices of words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization strategy and training\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we provide two different optimization strategies, both based on the AdamW algorithm [7], with the implementation provided in Pytorch [8].\n",
    "Moreover, we test both AdamW with a fixed learning rate and with a a learning rate scheduler, linear for ATE and polynomial for ABSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is performed with a batch size of 8, and 5 epochs for all the cases, as suggested for BERT models. While ATE is trained with a $3\\,10^{-5}$ learning rate, ABSE is trained with a $10^{-3}$ learning rate since the second approach shows a less stable trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. Text preprocessing and normalization;\n",
    "2. Aspect term extraction: training overview and comparison, testing, evaluation, and visualization;\n",
    "3. Aspect-based sentiment analysis:  training overview and comparison, testing, evaluation, and visualization;\n",
    "4. Conclusions and comparison with other results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we trained 8 different models, training has been performed separately and loaded in the present notebook. Nevertheless, we show the process of training by means of a plot of the training loss."

    "1. **FINE-TUNING**: the model tends to overlearn, since all the metrics concerning the train dataset are close to 1, while performances on the test dataset are low in terms of f1-score. The 0.92 accuracy of test data is mainly due to correct identification of non-aspect terms, which is not the matter of interest;\n",

In general, the task is accomplished with good results in terms of accuracy, f1-score is greater than or equal to 0.65.\n",
    "\n",

Indeed, we tested the training up to 10 epochs and computed the correspondent test accuracy: convergence is achieved after 5 epochs, even though the loss function keeps decreasing, thus it is better to limit the number of epochs chosen when training the model.\n",

    "In general, fine-tuning and adapter+scheduler exhibit lower values of precision/recall (f1-score) if compared with the other two. Therefore, we can conclude that fine-tuning with scheduler and simple adapter are the best models to identify negative and positive polarities, even though they have high proabability of failing in identifying neutral aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results could be easily understood, since the concept of \"neutral aspect\" is less clear than 'positive' and 'negative' polarities, also in a common spoken language. Moreover, if we think of possible applications of the provided architecture, we could argue that a possible customer of the model we build would be more interested in identifying negative and positive aspects, rather than neutral ones. As a consequence, we can conclude that even if it has limitations, the provided model can still be applied with good results to detect whether a sentence is positive or negative with respect to a certain aspect."
